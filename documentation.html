        <h2>What was the process like?</h2>
        <p>
            As of now, I've just been using some simple HTML and CSS! I'll be moving on to doing more with Javascript soon though!

        <h2>Resources used?</h2>
        <p>
            I've mostly used all of the content we've been going over in class; I had some basic HTML and CSS knowledge beforehand, but I've definitely learned a lot more since taking this class. I've luckily been able to apply it all to this project!

        <h2>Media used?</h2>
        <p>
            As of now, I currently only have an image that I drew as a little graphic on the index page. More will be added later to spice things up.

        <h2>How were project requirements met?</h2>
        <p>
            I'm not sure if I did the extent of what was needed for the very first assignment, but I have a pretty bare bones skeleton of what I want in my site. Plenty will be changed over time - I'm still getting used to Javascript. As of now though, this is the basic color scheme, font and layout. Things will be improved upon over time since there are still some specifics I'm unsure of.
