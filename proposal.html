        <h1>Deadly Dress-Up</h1>
        
        <br>
        
        <h2>High Concept</h2>
        <p>
            It's the <em>Dark Souls</em> of dress-up games, and the evil cousin of <em>Style Savvy</em>! <em>Deadly Dress-Up</em> asks players to dress up their zombie character in a way that will please the lords of the underworld within a limited amount of time. If they fail to do so...well, they can just try again; the Demon Lords aren't very good at their job either.

        <h2>Genre</h2>
        <p>
            While it's difficult to categorize a game as complex as <em>Deadly Dress-Up</em>, it likely would fit into these categories:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Casual</li>
            <li>Simulation</li>
            <li>Puzzle</li>
            <li>Memory</li>
            <li>Time Management</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Platform</h2>
        <p>
            This game is currently going to be a desktop only game, but there's the possibility for a mobile version in the future.

        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>
            You're a zombie who has just risen from the dead, but you have nothing to wear! To avoid embarrassing not only yourself, but the Demon Lord who let you rise from the dead, you need to pick a fantastic outfit. The only downside is that youre Demon Lord is having guests over soon, so you need to follow their instructions as to what outfit is appropriate. If you don't dress up well enough in time, then it's back to the un-undead for you!
        </p>
        <p>
            The game is fast paced, comedic and just generally light hearted. Each time the player makes an appropriate outfit, they are able to progress to the next level and have to make a new outfit to please someone else; each outfit would be increasingly more complex. Based on the scope of the class project however, I likely would not be able to make too many levels or any that are especially difficult.
        </p>

        <h2>Aesthetics</h2>
        <p>
           The graphics in <em>Deadly Dress-Up</em> are extremely cartoony and stylized; they fit the fun, but creepy, atmosphere. The game also will either have dark and demonic or light and perky music playing in the background (possibly something that embodies both). There also could be sound effects anytime the player selects something.

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <h3>Mechanics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Time: Players have a limited amount of time to make each outfit. If the time runs out, they need to start the game over as a new zombie.</li>
            <li>Choice: It’s important for a player to make sure they pay attention to what style the Demon Lord requests; not all clothing is the same.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Control</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Mouse: Players click and drag clothing options to their zombie character. They also use the mouse to click menu options and through any dialogue that may come up.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Teaching the Game</h3>
        <p>
            At the start of the game, there would be a basic level informing players of how it is to be played. They would need to make an outfit with a very limited, and clear selection of clothing styles that are extremely easy to tell apart.
        </p>
        <h3>Player Learning</h3>
        <p>
            The player needs to learn about basic fashion elements and styles. What’s boho-chic? Goth? Lolita? What’s the difference between leggings and tights? They need to differentiate between different requested clothing styles, since not too many people actually know these things. So, the Demon Lord could request for the zombie character to dress in Gothic clothing. The clothing options may include both gothic style items, and emo. But if the player selects mostly emo items, then they fail the level. If they select mostly gothic items with a few that are ambiguous, then they pass. The game becomes increasingly more difficult with each level, but that’s in hopes that the player learns more about clothing styles as time moves on.

        <h2>Other</h2>
        <p>
            It always frustrates me when people think two fashion styles are the same. Sure, some are similar, but there are so many different styles with their own individual flair. That was my inspiration for the game.
